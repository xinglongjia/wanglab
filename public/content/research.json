    "description": "Wang lab employs integrative approaches of classical epidemiology, genetic and molecular epidemiology, and machine learning algorithms to dissect this lethal disease by leveraging large population-based cohorts, national registries, biobanks, and electronic healthcare records and clinical images. Through innovatively applying diverse data sources with advanced analytical methodologies, we identify key factors contributing to the development and metastasis of pancreatic cancer. The goal of our research is to improve early diagnosis and increase survival of pancreatic cancer through facilitating personalized screening programs, treatments, and surveillance strategies.",
